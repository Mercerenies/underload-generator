Code generator and patterns for the [Underload programming
language](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Underload). I originally planned
to use this for Project Euler Problem #191, but it ended up being
prohibitively slow (Underload uses Church encoding for numbers, so we
have to be able to _run_ the Church encoding of the magnitude of the
result).

This infrastructure is still good, so I'll use it for a future
challenge.
